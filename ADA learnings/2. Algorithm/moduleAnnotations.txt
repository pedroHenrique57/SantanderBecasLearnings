 A algorithm is a step-by-step of how to do something, as a cake recipe for example. 
 In a brief way the ingredients will be our data (our variable), the how-to-make will be our algorithm (Take de data and use them according to the recipe)
and the action of make the cake it's out method. 

There are some tipes of data that can be used, including:
- Number
- Decimals
- Character
- Text (string)
- Boolean (true or false)

An algorithm it's a step-by-step. but the way it can work changes according to the necessity, like a CASE scenario, or a STEP scenario, and there goes by.
