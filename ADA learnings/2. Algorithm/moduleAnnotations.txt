  A algorithm is a step-by-step of how to do something, usually moduled into methods. 
  Take a cake recipe for example, the ingredients will be our data (our variable), the how-to-make will be our algorithm (Take de data and use them according to the recipe)
and the action of make the cake it's out method. 

  There are some tipes of data that can be used, including:
 - Number
 - Decimals
 - Character
 - Text (string)
 - Boolean (true or false)
  And all these tipes of data can be used on a array.

  An algorithm it's a step-by-step. but the way it can work changes according to the necessity, like a CASE scenario, or a STEP scenario, Repeticion scenario, etc.
  It's really important to take atencion on the algorithm, to optimize them for good performance and make them reasonable.
